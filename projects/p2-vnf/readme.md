#Project 2 - Anything
#Steve Berthiaume

As is apparent in the project itself, this project didn't exactly pan out for me. What I mainly mean by this is that at no point did I look at any of it and feel inspired, or like I had any real ideas for a direction to take it in. Paired with my minimal understanding and frequent hatred of HTML and CSS, this project quickly became a nightmare that I pushed off as more immediate things required my attention. I didn't seek help past a certain point out of shame, and I am fully aware that this project's failings are entirely my own, as I didn't make these things known.

This project was an attempt for me, as someone seeking to eventually make a visual novel with my girlfriend and wanting the most efficient tool to use, to discover whether I would want to use HTML and CSS, with added JQuery to tell a story. As such, everything was designed to be placeholders for an eventual *real* game, something which became progressively less realistic. This project, in the end, is more of an exploration of the disappointment it inevitably became from the perspective of those whose very existence is in question. The minimalist nature of the characters' appearance, while unimpressive, is something I view as working better with the tone of the project itself. While my initial view of this project was much more rich, with an actual storyline, potentially with branches, actual portraits and interesting environments,  I didn't achieve such a thing.

The most unchanged aspect of the project from my unattained vision and the reality is of course the user experience, and while I had wished to implement real interactivity, things didn't work out.

I apologize for the state of this project, and will accept whatever grade it receives.
